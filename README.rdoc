== README 

In this lesson I set up the structure of a new RoR app, named golp. 

I added several gems:  

Better Errors provides more useful error messages than the normal Rails error page. 

Quiet Assets suppresses messages in the development log to make it easier to find important messages. 

MetaRequest is a supporting gem for Rails Panel, which is a Google Chrome app. 

Awesome Print is a Ruby library that prints Ruby objects in color with proper indentation.  It can also be used to format Pry if the following code is added to your ~/.pryrc
require "awesome_print"
AwesomePrint.pry! 

Pry Rails works with (and depends on) Pry.  It makes the rails console open Pry. 

Binding Of Caller allows grabing bindings from arbitrarily far up the call stack to assist with debugging. 

Pry Byebug allows stepping through code in Pry and some other debugging functions. 


In Level 2 I added a route, controller, action, and view that generates a "Hello World" webpage. I also added an RSpec test that uses Capybara to test the feature that puts "Hello World" on the page. Capybara simulates a user of your website.  It can be used with an actual website, or with a headless browser like Phantom. 

spec_helper configures the testing environment.
